# Fall-Detection-Device---CNT-Capstone-2021
Fall Detection Device is a capstone project for CMPE2960 which me and my partner Sahibnoor Singh began in September 2021. The purpose of the device is to make the process of getting help after fall more efficient. 

Deliverables to be Completed:

The following deliverable still need to be completed as we got pushed behind schedule due to shipping delays. Although me and my partner are determined to pick up the pace and come back on schedule by effective communication and time management.

•	Program both sensors to give signal of a fall to output data on LCD
•	Program two buttons one for false detection and other to trigger detection
•	Complete program so it can run on boot
•	Do verification test to ensure stability and troubleshoot and issues encountered
